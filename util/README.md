This directory contains the minimal amount of code needed to convert
the default NuSTAR cleaned event files (in RA/DEC) to heliocentric
coordinates.

The user should make a subdirectory above this
(e.g. ../solar_correct_20140911) and copy the example script
in this directory to that location. The script will automatically
generate the appropraite subdirectories to store the files.
